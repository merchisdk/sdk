  In most cases, we recomend you use our Typescript SDK instead. It is newer,
  uses newer, more convenient programming techniques, and, of course, being
  typescript, allows for static typechecking.

  Nonetheless, a straight JavaScript version also exists, and is still
  maintained. One advantage of the JavaScript library is that it will work
  directly in browsers with no need to setup a compiler toolchain.
