   This section documents the list of filters available for reducing or
   searching list results. For examples of how to actually use the filters,
   check the individual SDK documentation for your programming language.

   Note that the Merchi backend will accept filter names either in `mixedCase`
   or `underscore_case`, but they are only listed here in `mixedCase`. Typically
   you would use whichever one is more idiomatic in your programming language,
   for example, the TypeScript SDK request object has property names for each
   filter in `mixedCase`.
