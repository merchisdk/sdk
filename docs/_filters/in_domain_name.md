   The `inDomainName` filter should be given a domain name.

   It is available on most entity types, and restricts the result set to
   only those entities belonging to the given domain (store).

   It is identical to `inDomain`, except that it operates by name rather than
   by id. `inDomain` and `inDomainName` are exclusive.
