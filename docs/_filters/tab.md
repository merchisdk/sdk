   The `tab` filter should be given a string representing the tab name.

   It restricts the result set to entities which would make sense displayed
   in a seperate UI tab.

   The following tab names are available on Notification entities:

      - read
      - unread

   It restricts the result set to only those entities that the specified user
   would have permission to access (as well as the current user also having
   access).
