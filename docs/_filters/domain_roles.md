   The `domainRoles` filter should be given a comma-seperated list of
   integers, each representing a permission role (see the Entity Reference
   enum for a complete list).

   Not to be confused with `inDomainRoles`, which is a seperate filter.

   It restricts the result set to only those domains with which the user
   is active in one of the specified roles.

   It is available only on the `Domain` entity.
