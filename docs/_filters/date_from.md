   The `dateFrom` filter should be given a unix timestamp (though, it will
   attempt to guess the meaning of other timestamp formats, too)

   It restricts the result set to only those entities which occur after
   the specified timestamp. Usually, the creation date of the entity is meant.

   It is available on the `Invoice` and `Job` entities.
