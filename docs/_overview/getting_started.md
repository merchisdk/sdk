  Welcome to the official merchi CRM API documentation page. This API document is designed for those interested in developing for the merchi CRM platform.

  In most cases, we recomend using one of our prebuilt SDK libraries, which
  are discussed first. However, if you do not like them, or one is not
  available for your preferred programming language, you can also talk directly
  to our REST API.

  You'll succeed if you do this.
  {: .success }

  Here's some useful information.
  {: .info }

  Something may not happen if you try and do this.
  {: .warning }

  Something bad will happen if you do this.
  {: .error }
