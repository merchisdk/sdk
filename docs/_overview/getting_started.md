  Welcome to the official merchi CRM API documentation page. This API document is designed for those interested in developing for the merchi CRM platform.

  In most cases, we recomend using one of our prebuilt SDK libraries, which
  are discussed first. They are available for TypeScript, JavasScript, and
  python.

  However, if you do not like them, or one is not available for your preferred programming language, you can also talk directly to our REST API.
