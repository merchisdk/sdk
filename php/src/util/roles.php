Defines the types ("roles") of user accounts that can exist
in the system. The information is stored per user as user.role. The role of
the logged in user making a request is used by the permissions system and
impacts the data that the user is allowed to access, as well as, in some
cases, the layout of the page that they see on the frontend. The roles
themselves are defined as integer constants
